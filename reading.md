# Reading Notes / Questions

### Ten Simple Rules

1. Who are the best and worst individuals to judge the clarity of your writing? Explain.
2. What is a step/action that can improve a paper during the process of writing it?
3. Do these papers follow their own advice? Identify one specific way mentioned to improve one of them. (This doesn't need to come from the same paper.)

### Agarwal and Bertozzi

You can just focus on 176–181.

1. What is a benefit and drawback of lysine-based conjugation?
2. Why does cystein-mediated conjugation require pre-treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT?
3. Do you think cystein-mediated conjugation is possible for most proteins? How about lysine-mediated conjugation? Why/why not?

### Shaffer et. al.

Focus on Figures 1–3 (don't worry about Figure 4).

1. What do the authors argue about the process of resistance development in Figure 1? How do they make this argument (statistical, experimental, other)? Describe.
2. What is the Gini coefficient? Why do the authors use it?
3. What is the experiment in Figure 3C? What is the author's hypothesis? Null hypothesis?

### Hafner et. al.

1. What is the argument the authors make when asserting we need a new drug response metric?
2. What is the IC~50~? E~max~?
3. How do the authors measure cell number? Are their methods specific to this type of assay?
4. Let's say you're measuring the drug response of an enzyme's activity—do you need to use the GR~50~? Why?

### Fraley et. al.

1. What are the cells the authors are studying? What is the dimensionality of the environment in which these cells migrate?
2. In Figure 5, what is the effect of bis-acrylamide treatment on the matrix? Why are the authors using it?
3. How do the authors determine whether matrix deformation was elastic or not?

### Engler et. al.

1. What are the three lineages into which MSC's can differentiate? How do these lineages correspond to their ECM environment?
2. What is blebbistatin? Why do the authors use it? What is the effect that they see?
3. What do the dotted lines in Figure 4D/E represent? Why do the authors do this experiment? What do they determine?

### Sun et. al.

1. How is stretchability related to fracture energy?
2. To what do the authors attribute the high alginate-polyacrylamide gel stretchability?
3. How is recovery of the gels for a second loading related to time between loadings and temperature? Is this what you would expect?
