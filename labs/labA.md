Lab 10: Evaluating Cell Viability in Hydrogels and Preparing

Substrates to Study Cell Behavior

Prelab reading 
===============

Read the posted instructions for the Live/Dead viability/cytotoxicity
kit from Molecular Probes.

You will evaluate the viability of your encapsulated cells using
fluorescent dyes. This type of labeling will enable you to see spatially
where dead and live cells are located in your alginate beads. Can you
predict where cells will be alive and where they will be dead? Can you
predict which concentrations of cells will have more live or dead cells?
While you may be able to count the number of dead and live cells in a
frame of the microscope to get a % viability, it would take many frames
and a lot of time to count all the cells in a single bead, and may not
be realistically possible. Challenge question: Think of a way to remove
the cells from the calcium alginate beads (hint: how is the gel
crosslinked?)

The type of information you get from this assay is different from the
previous assays you learned (BCA and MTS). It may be difficult to get an
average picture of the entire population in terms of total \# of cells
or metabolic activity, but it can give you spatial, visual, and
morphological information that you wouldn't get otherwise. These are
just some of the culture characteristics that you can look for in the
microscope if the cells are stained:

-   Spread or rounded

-   Clear or granular (lots of vacuoles)

-   Large or small

-   Releasing vesicles from its membrane or not

-   Many or few in the dividing stage of the cell cycle

-   Clustered in clumps or dispersed evenly throughout

In addition to the proliferation assays that we have covered in this
class, there are several other assays which characterize cells in
different ways. Can you name an assay which measures an aspect of cell
activity?

In the second part of this lab you will prepare your PDMS substrates for
cell seeding in the lab next week. You will need to prepare them for
cell culture. Your TA may ask you to perform this part of your lab first
or second to distribute the use of fluorescent microscopes during your
lab period.

Live/Dead stain 
================

Your TA will have the reagents warmed to room temperature. In the
future, make sure that they are room temperature before you open them,
or water will condense in the tube and degrade the reagents.

> **2.1 Preparation**

Reagents  {#reagents .ListParagraph}
=========

-   Your 6-well plate with alginate beads from the last lab

-   Your T25 flask from last lab

-   Complete medium from previous lab

-   Sterile DPBS from previous lab

-   Trypsin

-   Live/Dead kit from Molecular Probes (two reagents: calcein AM and
    ethidium homodimer)

Supplies  {#supplies .ListParagraph}
=========

-   Pipettes and tips

-   Pipet-aid and serological pipettes

-   15*mL* conical tubes

Equipment  {#equipment .ListParagraph}
==========

-   Phase contrast microscope

-   Centrifuge

-   Hemocytometer and cell counter

-   Fluorescent microscope

Safety  {#safety .ListParagraph}
=======

Wear your safety glasses, lab coat, and latex gloves. Continue to
practice good sterile cell culture techniques and proper biohazard waste
disposal. Be careful with the Live/Dead reagents. They are dissolved in
DMSO, which is an organic solvent and considered hazardous chemical
waste. Also remember that calcein AM and ethidium homodimer enter living
and dead cells, both of which exist on your skin. Wash promptly with
soap and water if you have contact with them. Don't look directly at the
fluorescent light beam coming from the microscope.

Procedure 
----------

1.  **Gauge confluency of your T-25 and change media.** Your T-25 should
    not be confluent so all you need to do is change media today.

2.  **Observe your 6 well plate under the microscope.** You may want to
    take a picture for your own records. Things you should be looking
    for are contamination, and if your cells have escaped from the
    beads.

3.  **Remove medium and rinse twice with DPBS for each well.** Use a
    micropipette and be careful not to lose any beads. Rinse for 5
    minutes

4.  **Aliquot 8 mL of sterile DPBS and add to it 1 uL of calcein AM, and
    2 uL of ethidium homodimer.** Your TA will have these sterile
    aliquots for you to add to your tube of DPBS, make sure to mix well
    using a vortexer.

5.  **Remove the rinse from your wells and place 2.5 mL's of the working
    solution into each well. **

6.  **Place into the incubator for 30-45 minutes.** A longer time may be
    necessary depending on the thickness of the beads.

7.  **Visualize under fluorescent microscopy, and take pictures.** Look
    at your samples under the fluorescent microscope, switching between
    the bright field (with appropriate phase contrast), GFP, and RFP
    filters to see green and red cells (alive and dead). In your lab
    report, you will be asked to summarize and describe your alginate
    beads. **Before lab section,** think about different ways to
    characterize your cell populations. Take pictures accordingly, so
    that you have data representing the different characteristics of the
    cells. An incomplete list of characteristics follows.

Bead Size, Bead Geometry, cell viability (percentage in a whole gel),
cell viability (as a function of depth into a bead), cell morphology,
cell density. Record interesting observations in your lab notebook.

Preparing varied stiffness substrates 
======================================

Your 24-well plate should be out of the oven now. You will prepare the
surfaces for cell seeding today and seed cells on them next week.

> **3.1 Preparation**

Reagents  {#reagents-1 .ListParagraph}
=========

Complete medium from previous lab

Sterile DPBS from previous lab

Your 24-well plate with PDMS substrates from the last lab

70% ethanol

Supplies  {#supplies-1 .ListParagraph}
=========

Pipettes and tips

Pipet-aid and serological pipettes

Safety  {#safety-1 .ListParagraph}
=======

Wear your usual protective equipment.

Procedure 
----------

1\. **In the hood, add 500 uL of 70% Ethanol to each well with PDMS,
incubate with the lid on for 30 minutes**. Prolonged contact with
ethanol will ensure sterilization of the surface. PDMS is highly
hydrophobic and should not take up any of the ethanol.

2\. **Aspirate the 70% ethanol and rinse with 500 uL of DPBS 4 times.**
Excess rinses will ensure that any residual ethanol leaves.

3\. **Store your well plate in the incubator.** Do your best to maintain
sterility!
