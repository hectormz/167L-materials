1. Replica Molding 
===================

1.1 Prelab reading

> Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a thermosetting polymer that is
> commonly used for replica molding. Any elastic polymer could be used
> for replica molding. PDMS has many desirable characteristics:

-   It is moderately stiff (shear mod.= 0*.*25*M Pa*, Young's =
    0*.*5*MPa*)

-   It conforms to a surface with atomic level contact (good seals,
    microfluidic devices)

-   It is non-toxic and commercially available (\$80/kg)

-   It is optically transparent to 300*nm*

-   It is hydrophobic, but can be made hydrophilic with oxygen plasma

-   It can adhere and seal reversibly, or irreversibly after oxidation,
    to many different surfaces

> **1.2 Preparation **

Reagents 
=========

-   Sylgard 184 base

-   Sylgard 184 curing agent

Supplies 
=========

-   Plastic transfer pipettes

-   Weigh boats

-   Acrylic stencil molds in small petri dishes

-   1 large (100cm) plastic petri dish

-   50 mL conical tube

Equipment 
==========

-   Oven at 60 *^◦^* C

-   Vacuum dessicator

Safety 
=======

> Wear your usual protective equipment. Take care when handling the
> Sylgard reagents. They are very oily and difficult to remove. You may
> need to change your gloves frequently to keep from spreading this
> reagent to your bench space, equipment, and clothes. Keep some paper
> towels nearby to help contain any spills or accidents.

1.3 Procedure 
--------------

> Acrylic stencil molds have been prepared already. Features were etched
> in the hard acrylic with a laser cutter. Please perform handling of
> PDMS solutions inside the fume hood. All the necessary supplies for
> this lab will be located in the fume hood.

1.  **PDMS is oily and may be difficult to remove from surfaces. If
    gloves become contaminated with PDMS, replace them before touching
    anything else, especially the balance and the vacuum chamber.**

2.  The recommended base to curing agent ratio for Sylgard 184 (PDMS) is
    10 to 1 by weight. Estimate the total volume that will occupy the
    acrylic mold.

3.  Weigh your components in a 50 mL conical tube using the scale
    located in the fume hood.

4.  Stir to mix the two components with the transfer pipette. After
    mixing well pour the solution into the mold provided.

5.  Degas the PDMS. Place the molds in the large plastic petri dish with
    your initials on it. You may share a vacuum dessicator with other
    teams; wait until your vacuum dessicator is full before starting.
    Place the petri dish in the vacuum chamber. (Check with the TA
    before continuing) Close the chamber, ensuring the o-ring is
    properly situated. Connect the chamber to the vacuum line coming
    from the bench top. Make sure the valve on the vacuum chamber is
    open, and then open the vacuum line. Air within the PDMS will leave
    via bubbles. Be careful not to tip the chamber or you will spill
    your PDMS. This process should take approximately 30 minutes. Record
    the time you started the vacuum and how long it takes to remove the
    bubbles.

6.  Once all the bubbles have disappeared, close the valve on the vacuum
    chamber, close the vacuum line, remove the vacuum line, then reopen
    the vacuum chamber **slowly**. Be careful not to tip the chamber
    again, or you may spill your PDMS since it is not cured yet. Remove
    the lid of the vacuum chamber and place the petri dish of molds in
    the oven, set to 60 ◦ C. They will be removed by your TA. Make sure
    your initials are on your petri dishes.

3. Fluorescence Microscopy 
===========================

> **SAFETY: Wear gloves to protect yourself from any substances you are
> handling and to keep the equipment clean, but take your gloves off to
> use the computer keyboard and mouse.**

3.1 Preparing the sample 
-------------------------

1.  Obtain and clean a glass slide and cover slip with 70% ethanol and a
    kimwipe.

2.  Dispense 10*µL* of the fluorescent bead suspension (provided by the
    TA) onto the glass slide.

> **3.** Place a cover slip on top of the drop. Bring the slide to a
> fluorescent microscope for examination.

3.2 Using the Microscope 
-------------------------

###  AMG EVOS Microscopes 

> Your TA will demonstrate how to use the microscope in class. Be sure
> to follow along and write down your own procedure, and ask the TA to
> clarify as necessary.
>
> Take pictures of the fluorescent beads so that you can measure their
> size for your lab reports.
