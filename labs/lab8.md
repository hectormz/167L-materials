# BE 167L - Bioengineering Laboratory

# Lab 8: Growth Kinetics (MTS Assay)

Prelab reading 
===============

Read the posted technical article from BioTechniques (vol 37, p406-412,
2004). Also read the instructions for the CellTiter 96 AQeous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay from Promega.

You will learn how to use the MTS assay, which is a measure of metabolic
activity of living cells. Since all cells in a given population
generally have similar metabolic activity, this assay can have a
relatively linear correlation to the number of live cells. Rather than a
measure of total protein content, like the BCA assay, which can include
already dead cells and secreted proteins from cells, this assay measures
an activity of LIVING cells. Can you think of reasons to use the BCA
assay over the MTS assay? Can you think of reasons to use the MTS assay
over the BCA assay? The posted article describes conditions under which
the MTS assay become inaccurate as an indicator of cell number. It is
important, when learning new assays, to understand how they work so that
details that may contribute to discrepancies are found sooner rather
than later. In your future work, be conscientious about doing your
research into products and kits purchased from companies. Make sure they
are appropriate for your working range and you perform the proper
controls before collecting data on your experimental samples.

You will collect and count your cells from your two seeding conditions
from 1 well (of your 4), then you will measure metabolic activity with
the MTS assay (CellTiter 96) in the remaining wells. You will use some
of your left over cells from your counting wells to create a known
concentration of cells and serial dilutions to generate a standard curve
for cell number. Based on your cell counts and your standard curve, you
can determine the accuracy and range of your MTS assay. Compare your
results with the rest of the class the next time you meet and discuss
what your collective results mean.

Procedure 
----------

You must do this lab in sequence to ensure that you have enough cells
for your standard curve. Lab partners can trypsinize the 96-well plate
and the T25 flask in parallel, but make sure you coordinate how you will
combine all your cells in the later steps. Read through the entire
procedure before you begin so you can coordinate your tasks efficiently.
Be careful this time with your volume measurements. The counting and
assay are dependent on concentrations so you must be rigorous about
creating precise dilutions in order to make meaningful comparisons.

### Cell counting and standard curve seeding 

1.  Check confluency of the cells you seeded in the 96 well plate.
    Coordinate with the TA to get a look at the wells you seeded.

2.  Previously, you seeded 4 wells each of different densities. You will
    trypsinize (100 uL trypsin) ONE of each density and leave six wells
    (three of each density) untouched.

3.  Once the cells are detached, add exactly 200µL of media to each and
    rinse/pipette to detach the cells and suspend them uniformly.

4.  Remove the cells from the trypsinized wells and count them on the
    hemacytometer, you may need to either concentrate or dilute your
    cell mixture.

5.  Put the 96-well plate back into the incubator.

6.  Count each of the cell suspensions you collected in the
    microcentrifuge tubes and calculate how many total cells were in
    each well and their cell densitites and record them in your lab
    notebook.

7.  Your lab partner may, at the same time, trypsinize the T25 flask and
    count the number of cells in that flask. Try to count your cells
    after resuspension (Note: you should try to do this in general from
    now on)

8.  In your assigned rows of the 96 well cell culture plate, you will
    seed a serial dilution of your trypsinized cells from the flask.

9.  Resuspend your cells in fresh media so that you have 1 million
    cells/mL in the 15mL tube from your T25 flask.

10. Plate 6 densities of cells into the plate, making sure that you have
    a total of exactly 100µL of media in each well at the end: 0 (just
    medium), 3,000cells/cm^2^, 6,000cells/cm^2^, 12,000cells/cm^2^,
    24,000cells/cm^2^, and 48,000cells/cm^2^.

11. You can now re-plate cells from your T25 flask into a new T25 flask
    for next week's labs. Make sure you don't seed too densely! Based on
    your experience from now you should be able to estimate how dense
    you need to seed them. You may ask your TA for assistance if you are
    unsure.

### MTS assay 

1.  Your TA will have the CellTiter 96 AQeous One Solution Cell
    Proliferation reagent thawed and ready for your use. Collect a 250µL
    of the CellTiter reagent from your TA.

2.  Aspirate the medium from your remaining wells, which you did NOT
    trypsinize. And add 100 uL of fresh media back in.

3.  Add 20 uL of CellTiter 96 AQeous One solution to each of your wells
    from the 96 well plate (each well should already contain 100µL of
    media)

<!-- -->

5.  Allow the 96-well plates to incubate with the assay reagent for 1
    hour.

6.  Your TA will now take the entire class to the plate reader to read
    the absorbance's, make sure you record the values associated with
    your wells.
