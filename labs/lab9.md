Lab 9: 3D Encapsulation and Preparing Varied Stiffness Substrates 
==================================================================

1. Prelab reading 
------------------

Read the first 5 pages of the posted article "Encapsulation of Cells in
Alginate Gels". You do not have to read the methods unless you are
curious. The procedure outlined below is different from that described
in the article. There are two parts to your lab today. You may be asked
to start with either the 3D encapsulation or the substrate preparation
depending on the time. You will encapsulate your 3T3 cells in alginate
hydrogel beads for culture today, and evaluate their viability at
different encapsulation densities in the next lab period. The second
section of this lab is preparation for your last two defined labs next
week. You will prepare substrates of PDMS with varying stiffnesses so
that you can seed your 3T3 cells onto them and evaluate their behavior
in response to different stiffnesses.

2. 3D encapsulation 
--------------------

If time permits, your TA will give a demonstration on how to encapsulate
cells in alginate beads before you begin work with your cells. Once you
have encapsulated your cells, you will allow them to incubate until the
next lab, when you will evaluate them using a new technique that
identifies individual live and dead cells.

**2.1 Preparation**

Reagents 
---------

-   Your T25 flask from last lab

-   Complete medium from previous lab

-   Sterile DPBS from previous lab

-   Trypsin

-   Sodium alginate

-   0*.*1*M CaCl*~2~ solution

Supplies 
---------

-   Pipettes and tips

-   Pipet-aid and serological pipettes

-   microcentrifuge tubes

-   15*mL* conical tubes

-   1 6-well cell culture plate

-   1 T25 flask

Equipment 
----------

-   Phase contrast microscope

-   Centrifuge

-   Hemocytometer and cell counter

### 2.2 Procedure 

1.  **Check confluency of your T-25 and begin passaging (further
    detailed in step 3).** You will use these cells for today's
    encapsulation and seeding another T-25 flask.

2.  **While one member passages, aseptically aliquot 5 mL of sodium
    alginate solution**. (The concentration of sodium alginate is 15
    mg/mL)

3.  **Basic passaging procedure**

    a.  Rinse with DPBS (2mL)

    b.  Trypsinize (2 mL)

    c.  Deactivate trypsin with media (4 mL)

    d.  Centrifuge for five minutes at 150 x g/rcf (Check with the TA
        prior to centrifuging)

    e.  Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of media

    f.  Count resuspended cells

4.  **Seed a new T-25.** You will use these cells for labs next week, so
    you can seed at a lower density. \~100000 cells per flask is
    acceptable.

5.  **Split your remaining cells into 3 new tubes** **(1:2, 1:3, 1:6)**.
    So if you had 900 uL of cell solution left, you should have 3 tubes,
    one with 450 uL of cell solution, one with 300 uL of cell solution,
    and one with 150 uL of cell solution. Make sure you record how many
    cells are in each tube.

6.  **Fill the 3 cell solution tubes to the 5 mL mark with DPBS, and
    centrifuge.** You are rinsing the cells one more time prior to
    encapsulation in this step.

7.  **Aspirate the DPBS and resuspend in 1*mL* of the alginate solution
    for each tube.** You should now have 3 tubes with different cell
    density that you can calculate from before.

8.  **Bring a 6 well plate into the hood, and aliquot 2.5 mL of .1M
    calcium chloride solution per well.** Make sure this is done under
    sterile conditions. You can label your 6 well plate for the 3
    different densities at this time as well.

9.  **Use a 1000 uL pipette to dropwise from the appropriate tube to
    each well.** Do this slowly, and be careful to not aggregate beads.
    Your TA may demonstrate this part of the procedure for you at this
    time.

10. **Incubate at RT for 10 minutes, then rinse 4 times with sterile DI
    H2O.** These rinsing steps remove the excess calcium ions. Using a
    1000 uL pipette to remove the water is easiest, an aspirating
    pipette may suck up the alginate beads.

11. **Fill each well with cells with 5 mL of media.** The encapsulated
    cells require more media to survive.

3. Preparing varied stiffness substrates 
-----------------------------------------

You will make thin layers of PDMS using 3 different ratios of base to
cross-linker (10:1, 30:1, and 60:1) in order to get different
stiffnesses. These substrates will be used for next week's lab. It is
important to keep this layer as thin as possible which will make
microscopy possible. It is also important to keep the layers the same
thickness between replicates so that their bulk stiffnesses are the
same. Thickness of less than 2*mm* is realistically achievable.

**3.1 Preparation**

Reagents 
---------

-   Sylgard 184 base

-   Sylgard 184 curing agent

Supplies 
---------

-   Plastic transfer pipettes

-   weigh boats/50 mL conical tube

-   1 24-well plate

Equipment 
----------

-   Oven at 60 *◦* C

-   Vacuum dessicator

Safety 
-------

Wear your usual protective equipment. Take care when handling the
Sylgard reagents. They are very oily and difficult to remove. You may
need to change your gloves frequently to keep from spreading this
reagent to your bench space, equipment, and clothes. Keep some paper
towels nearby to help contain any spills or accidents.

### 3.2 Procedure 

1.  **Make about 1-3 mL of your three base and curing agent mixtures.**
    The ratios are 10:1, 30:1, 60:1 (do not waste curing reagent! You
    can use either a 50 mL tube to mix or a weigh boat.

2.  **Dispense a small and equal amount of PDMS to individual wells of a
    24 well plate**. You want at least 3 wells of each condition. You
    want the amount of PDMS in each well to be equal, and to fully cover
    the well. Use whatever transfer method works best for you, and to
    fully cover the well you can rotate the well plate to fully cover
    the bottom. You will want to aim for \~200 uL of solution per well.

3.  **De-gas in the vacuum dessicator for 30 minutes and then place your
    plate in the oven for at least 3 hours.** It is ok if the plates are
    left in the incubator until the next lab
