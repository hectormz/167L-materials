> Lab 6: Gauging Confluency and Growth Kinetics

Prelab reading 
===============

> Culture Guide posted on CCLE. **

Being able to look at a flask of cells and estimate a rough order of
magnitude for the number of cells is a useful skill. You may be growing
cells for an experiment and need to estimate how long it will take to
grow enough cells. Also estimating the confluency of a flask and how
much time you might have before they become confluent is important for
knowing when to passage cells before they become too confluent. Once
they become confluent they may stop dividing and enter a different phase
of the cell cycle, which may not be desirable for your experiment. You
would typically passage cells when they reach 80-90% confluency. 100%
confluency means that cells cover 100% of the available surface area.
Look at the figures below for an idea of what cells look like at
different densities on a culture surface.

Figure 1: Different densities of cells are shown in this series of
images from a phase contrast microscope in the teaching lab. These cells
were cultured in tissue culture flasks you will be using and were
counted before and after plating using a hemocytometer. The estimated
confluencies are given in percentages and the rough number of cells per
*cm*^2^ are given in parentheses.

Gauging confluency

Procedure 
----------

1.  Remove your 6 well plate of cells from the incubator

2.  Look at each of them under the EVOS microscope using phase contrast,
    noting the uniformity or non- uniformity of distribution of the
    cells.

3.  Take a representative photo from each of your wells.

4.  Wipe the flasks with 70% ethanol prior to putting it back in the
    incubator, unless you are ready to begin the next section.

Procedure 
----------

1.  Follow the same procedure as the last lab to trypsinize each of your
    wells and your T25 into separately labeled 15*mL* centrifuge tubes.
    Share the flasks among your team members so that each student gets
    practice.

2.  A brief re-cap of the procedure from the last lab:

    -   Aspirate the medium from the flask and rinse twice with DPBS

    -   Add trypsin, cap, and place in the incubator for 3-5 minutes.
        Check the flask under the microscope to see when cells are
        lifted. Agitate if needed.

    -   Add complete medium to the trypsin to deactivate the enzyme.

    -   Pipette the cell suspension gently up and down to detach cells
        from each other and the flask. Use the serological pipette to
        measure your total volume.

    -   Transfer to a 15*mL* centrifuge tube and collect a small known
        volume for counting on the hemocytometer.

3.  Before centrifuging your 15*mL* tubes, remove 200*µL* from each tube
    to a separately labeled microcentrifuge tube, keeping track of what
    densities are in each tube.

4.  While you are spinning down your cells, count the cells in your
    microcentrifuge tubes to determine the total number of cells in each
    of your 15*mL* tubes.

5.  Prepare a 6-well cell culture plate with 3 *mL* of fresh complete
    medium in each well for your lab next week.

6.  You may pool your cells from your 15*mL* centrifuge tubes or just
    use one tube as your source. Resuspend your cells in the appropriate
    amount of medium to make a 1 million *cells/mL* suspension.

> **7.** In your 12-well plate, seed the top row with 1500
> *cells/cm*^2^, the bottom row with 5000 cells/cm^2^, then seed the
> bottom row with 10000 *cells/cm*^2^.

9.  Re-plate 1 T25 flask with at least 150,000 cells total.

10. You may discard your left-over cells by aspirating them.
