<h3 id="ten-simple-rules">Ten Simple Rules</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Who are the best and worst individuals to judge the clarity of your writing? Explain.</li>
  <li>What is a step/action that can improve a paper during the process of writing it?</li>
  <li>Do these papers follow their own advice? Identify one specific way mentioned to improve one of them. (This doesn’t need to come from the same paper.)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="agarwal-and-bertozzi">Agarwal and Bertozzi</h3>

<p>You can just focus on 176–181.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is a benefit and drawback of lysine-based conjugation?</li>
  <li>Why does cystein-mediated conjugation require pre-treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT?</li>
  <li>Do you think cystein-mediated conjugation is possible for most proteins? How about lysine-mediated conjugation? Why/why not?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="shaffer-et-al">Shaffer et. al.</h3>

<p>Focus on Figures 1–3 (don’t worry about Figure 4).</p>

<ol>
  <li>What do the authors argue about the process of resistance development in Figure 1? How do they make this argument (statistical, experimental, other)? Describe.</li>
  <li>What is the Gini coefficient? Why do the authors use it?</li>
  <li>What is the experiment in Figure 3C? What is the author’s hypothesis? Null hypothesis?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hafner-et-al">Hafner et. al.</h3>

<ol>
  <li>What is the argument the authors make when asserting we need a new drug response metric?</li>
  <li>What is the IC~50~? E~max~?</li>
  <li>How do the authors measure cell number? Are their methods specific to this type of assay?</li>
  <li>Let’s say you’re measuring the drug response of an enzyme’s activity—do you need to use the GR~50~? Why?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="fraley-et-al">Fraley et. al.</h3>

<ol>
  <li>What are the cells the authors are studying? What is the dimensionality of the environment in which these cells migrate?</li>
  <li>In Figure 5, what is the effect of bis-acrylamide treatment on the matrix? Why are the authors using it?</li>
  <li>How do the authors determine whether matrix deformation was elastic or not?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="engler-et-al">Engler et. al.</h3>

<ol>
  <li>What are the three lineages into which MSC’s can differentiate? How do these lineages correspond to their ECM environment?</li>
  <li>What is blebbistatin? Why do the authors use it? What is the effect that they see?</li>
  <li>What do the dotted lines in Figure 4D/E represent? Why do the authors do this experiment? What do they determine?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sun-et-al">Sun et. al.</h3>

<ol>
  <li>How is stretchability related to fracture energy?</li>
  <li>To what do the authors attribute the high alginate-polyacrylamide gel stretchability?</li>
  <li>How is recovery of the gels for a second loading related to time between loadings and temperature? Is this what you would expect?</li>
</ol>
